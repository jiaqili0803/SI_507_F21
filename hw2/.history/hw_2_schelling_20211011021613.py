'''Problem #1'''

# The class AgentNew randomly picks whether an agent will be purple or gold.
# We may want to specify that instead, so lets create two subclasses of AgentNew.
# Let's call them PurpleAgents and GoldAgents.
# Below is flawed code for the subclass PurpleAgents.
# You can fix it simply by deleting/editing the mistakes I have made.
# You don't have to add any new lines.
# Once it's fixed, go ahead and create an analogous subclass called GoldAgents,
# which has the default group="Gold".

'''Problem #3'''

# We're going to build a method called 'check_neighbors' which will identify

# given agent. Once those agents are identified, we'll calculate if enough of
# them are of the same group to meet our pre-determined threshold.

'''Problem #7'''

# Even if people don't mind being a minority in their neighborhood, you still
# get segregation pretty easily according to this model. For a long time models
# such as this were used to argue that some degree of segregation was
# inevitable, and therefore it should not be a target of policy.

# Let's challenge that assumption.
# Make 2 new subclasses, 'PurpleDiversitySeekers' and 'GoldDiversitySeekers'.
# Please use those exact names to allow for autograding.
# For these subclasses, make them seek out diversity instead of avoid it.
# Run some simulations with 300 traditional PurpleAgents, 300 traditional
# GoldAgents, 100 PurpleDiversitySeekers, and 100 GoldDiversitySeekers.
# What happens now?
